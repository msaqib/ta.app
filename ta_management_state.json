The first reason is that I have experienced firsthand how good TA support can help improve the course experience and can be a make-or-break for some students as well. CS200 is not like other courses, since the students are actively seeking guidance from their TAs in assignments and labs. Oftentimes, it would feel like the labs are significantly more difficult, and as I currently see it, the lectures and the pre-labs would not help me prepare myself most of the time, and it remained a huge struggle for me throughout the semester.  I don't just see this as a TA ship, I want to help bridge the gap between lectures and assignments given to us, so that the correct amount of difficulty is being provided to the students and they are able to have a challenge, yet at the same time don't feel like it's a burden. I also hope to incorporate a possible recitation one time a week where we are solving a set of questions as TAs, in front of the students, and they are provided with more resources to study. This approach will help students develop a better problem-solving mindset and have stuff other than the pre-labs that they can use to practice, for example, they can go through the questions themselves and then watch the TA to gain feedback.  I want to TA this course to help improve the current procedures of CS Specific TA Ships.",

Additionally, due to the cancellation of finals that semester, I was unable to recover or demonstrate the progress I had made.  Despite this, the course left a lasting impact on me. It frustrated me not because of the material, but because I knew I could do much better. That frustration became motivation. After the semester ended, I took the initiative to thoroughly revisit the course content, working through the concepts with far more focus and clarity. What initially seemed like a setback became an opportunity for deeper learning and personal growth.  Now, I want to TA this course not only to prove to myself that I have truly mastered the material but also to support students who may be facing their own challenges\u2014academic or otherwise.

Although I received a B in CS200 and a B+ in Data Structures, both grades were affected by illness and extremely low iron levels during the second half of Fall and first half of Spring semesters, which limited my ability to complete final assignments and exam prep: not due to weak conceptual understanding. Since then, I\u2019ve thoroughly revisited the material, strengthened my grasp through tutorials and practice (especially with STL, inheritance, memory management, and problem decomposition) and I now feel confident in my ability to support students. I understand the pace and challenges of this course and am eager to guide others, especially during labs, toward mastering the same skills.",

The TAs played a big role in helping me understand the concepts taught in the class. They clarified concepts and guided me whenever I was stuck. Their support helped me build confidence, and I started to dream of becoming one of them someday.

I want to be the TA that is there to support them in this journey by being approachable, understanding and willing to teach them the concepts that they might not be able to comprehend earlier.

This is where I want to play the role, bridging the gap between the students and the materials to ensure they understand the concepts thoroughly without just memorizing the code or using ai tools. Additionally, I see the TA-ship as an opportunity for me to grow and learn both as a communicator and a leader.

This is a course that can really make or break a student's outlook towards CS as a major. When I took the course, I felt there were some gaps in communication between the course staff and students. I have several ideas on how to bridge those gaps and make the CS 200 experience one where students learn and grow together so when they leave this course they have not only developed a strong foundation but are also keen on exploring the concepts more.

I focused on optimising the code and restructuring it using modularisation, something that ties directly to CS200\u2019s core OOP concepts. Alongside that, I also did an internship where I worked heavily with OOP. I\u2019ve grown a lot in terms of programming skills since I took CS200. These experiences have strengthened my grasp of the subject and have motivated me to apply for a TAship in CS200. Back then, while the concepts were easy to grasp, the way the course was organised made the programming side really difficult for me, which affected my grade. I want to help ensure that incoming students have a smoother, more structured experience with this foundational course. Given how essential OOP is for any CS major, I believe it\u2019s important to bridge the gap between theory and practice early on, and I\u2019m committed to making that transition easier for others than it was for me.",

When I took CS200, I also found out through my TAs that understanding these core ideas deeply made later courses much more manageable and enjoyable.  I\u2019m particularly interested in TAing this course because I know how challenging it can be for students who are just starting to transition from beginner programming into more abstract or theoretical thinking. I\u2019ve been in that position myself, and I remember how helpful it was when a TA could break things down clearly or offer a new perspective. I want to be that support system for others \u2014 whether that\u2019s helping someone through a confusing assignment, debugging with them, or guiding them conceptually during office hours.  Beyond helping students succeed, I also see TAing as an opportunity for personal growth. Teaching others is one of the best ways to solidify my own understanding, and I value the challenge of communicating technical ideas clearly and patiently. I enjoy working collaboratively, and I\u2019d be excited to contribute to a supportive learning environment that helps every student get the most out of CS200.

Outside of coursework, I applied a few of these concepts in a personal project, a terminal-based Sudoku solver written in C++ using recursive backtracking and 2D arrays. Through this project, I was able to reinforce and build upon the concepts I had learned from the assignments. You can view the project here: https://github.com/huda-kamran/sudoku-solver This TAship opportunity will allow me to assist other TAs in marking labs and will provide me with the opportunity to contribute by designing innovative labs and assignments that will not only reinforce students\u2019 learning but will also leave a lasting positive impact on their CS journeys. I have found that explaining concepts not only helps others but also deepens my own understanding. During CS 200, I genuinely enjoyed discussing foundational ideas with my classmates and helping them grasp difficult concepts, and I look forward to doing the same for future students.",

Having been recommended to try for TA-ship by the Head TAs of CS 200 when I took it, I put it off until I could work my CGPA up to a reasonable point, and found a semester with a more manageable workload. I believe myself to now be ready, and look forward to the valuable experience official TA-ship would provide. I am also retaking the final for CS 202, with high hopes of raising my grade in the course, so please do take that into account.",

But as I spent more time understanding how things work under the hood, it actually became intuitive. I started appreciating the level of control you get in C, and how important memory management is. Then moving to C++ and learning about structures and object-oriented programming was the clarity required. The journey from confusion to clarity and interactive class sessions made the course really fun. I would love to help other students go through that same process and support them while making them appreciate the learning. This will enhance my communication skills as well as contribute to further understanding of programming concepts.",

It is important to build fundamentals and the right guidance at this stage can greatly benefit students and help them build their skills. In the generation of AI it is important to have adequate guidance so a person can build their own critical thinking skills rather than relying on AI. I\u2019d like to bridge the gap between lectures and coding and help students learn and stand independently on their own rather than running to AI. Furthermore, I\u2019ve been interested in teaching for quite a long time and have been doing so since my o levels. I wish to not only help the students but also provide good support to the instructor teaching the course and aid them in planning activities which may help the students flourish and learn more while taking this course ",
